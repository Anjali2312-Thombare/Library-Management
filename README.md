# Library-Management


This GitHub repository contains a Java program for a Library Management System. The program simulates a library environment with functionalities for librarians and users. The system allows librarians to add, delete, and update book information, view book details, print books in order, and display the binary search tree of books. Users can issue and return books, and the system provides due date notifications for overdue books, along with applicable charges.

Key Features:
1. **Library Class:** Contains methods for inserting, updating, and deleting books using a binary search tree. It also has functions to print book details and the binary search tree structure.

2. **Student Class:** Represents student information with attributes like name, ID, stream, and number of issued books.

3. **Data Structures:** The program employs data structures such as arrays and hash maps to store and manage book and student information efficiently.

4. **User Authentication:** The system has basic user authentication with predefined librarian credentials to access librarian-specific functionalities.


5. **Date and Time Handling:** The program utilizes the `java.util.Date` and `java.text.SimpleDateFormat` classes to handle date and time information for book issuing and returning.


This library management system provides a user-friendly command-line interface for easy interaction. It offers robust book management functionalities for librarians and streamlined book issuing/returning processes for users.
